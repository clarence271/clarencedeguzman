	Until I started studying in the city with my mother who looked after me at <b> Cabanatuan East Central School</b><br/>I had fun studying elementary school in the east 
	I met many children and different kinds of people who were very different children quite advance the game like technology and computer<br/>

	<p> When I was in high school I became aware of the reality of life where there was a lot of fighting. 
	My studies in high school were not easy, many were motivated and I was fooled by the computer and did not go to school for 2 months or a grading study.
	But I realized what I was doing was wrong and I continued I passed everything I needed in my class for me to catch up and continued I finished my grade 8 at <b>NEHS</b> and
	I continued my grade 9 studies at <b>UNHS </b> in our area. and I sober up and improved my education and I was moving up grade 10 and I went back to 
	Cabanatuan City to study senior high in the BSIT course and was able to finish with honors </p>
	
	<p>My dream is to become a <b> Computer Engineer </b>because in the modern generation many people are interested in technology</br> 
	 and one of me don so I want to be a computer engineer because I want to help the development or development of our community<br/>
	 by making modern computer technologies that can help more our country to expedite and facilitate activities in our country and <br/>
	of course to help my parents with this great job opportunities</p>
